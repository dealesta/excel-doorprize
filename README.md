This is very simple example of how to utilize macro in an excel file to draw doorprizes.

There are 2 sheets:
1. Doorprize
   This is the sheet you do the drawing. 
3. Daftar Peserta
   Here you need to populate data to be used in the drawing. If the data is more than 100 row, you need to adjust the 'DATA_PESERTA' name
